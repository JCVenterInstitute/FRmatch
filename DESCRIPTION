Description: FR-Match is a cell type cluster mapping algorithm for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. It is based on a statistical test called Friedman-Rafsky (FR) test, which is a multivariate generalization of nonparametric two-sample test. This package also provides visualization tools for the implemented method.
