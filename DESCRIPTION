Description: FR-Match is a cell type cluster mapping algorithm for single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The core method is based on a statistical test called Friedman-Rafsky (FR) test, which is a multivariate non-parametric test. This package implements the core algorithms and companion visualization tools for the method.
