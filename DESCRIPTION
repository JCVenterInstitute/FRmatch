Description: FR-match is a novel cell cluster mapping algorithm for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) data. It is based on a statistical test called Friedman-Rafsky (FR) test, which is a multivariate generalization of nonparametric two-sample test. FR-match performs cluster-to-cluster matching for two scRNA-seq experiments. It utilizes gene expression data, cluster membership information, and marker genes found by the "NS-Forest" algorithm to cross-compare the cell type clusters found in two scRNAseq experiments, namely query and reference. This package also provides graphical tools for the implemented method.
